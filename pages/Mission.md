Our planet faces an anthropological extinction, exacerbated by decades of unsustainability. I am committed to a #zerowaste future, follow along with my mission here: 

<b>1. Decreasing plastic waste</b> </p>
   Although plastic waste is predominated by fishing equipment in the ocean, consumer waste still makes up a significant portion of waste. While I don't see paper straws as the smartest move, there are other ways of decreasing plastic waste. I always bring my own utensils in a reusable bag, which I wash after lunches in the hospital cafe. I stopped buying bottles of shampoo and conditioner, and now use shampoo and conditioner bars from Ethique.

<b>2. Going meatless</b> </p>
   What I thought would have been a major challenge ended up being the easiest change of all. I had never enjoyed cooking meat, and I found it easy to cut meat out of my diet. In addition, I am slowly decreasing consumption of animal products. I've started making my own oat milk to replace my whole milk (it's delicious and froths well too!)

<b>3. No-buy</b> </p>
   It's easy to look at ads and impulsively purchase a nifty new gadget, a gorgeous new shirt, or a beautifully packaged makeup-item. The best way to lead a sustainable life is to simply buy less. Resources are consumed at an unsustainable rate to keep up with fast-fashion. Child labor is implicated in mica-mining for makeup. More and more waste is generated when we buy and toss out. For this reason, for the next year (June 2021-June2022), I will not purchase any articles of clothing or makeup. I will focus on using up all of my current skincare and personal care items before repurchasing.
