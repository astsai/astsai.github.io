        OUR RESEARCH<br>
      Our research broadly covers synthetic biology and technology development, with focus on genome-editing, immunology, and gene therapy. To invent genome engineering technologies, we capitalize on nucleic acid manipulation, protein engineering, directed evolution, and high-throughput methodologies. Our overarching motivation is to establish safe and efficacious genome therapeutics for routine human use.
